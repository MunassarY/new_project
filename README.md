# Introdution
# üìä Data Analyst Job Market Insights

This project analyzes job postings to uncover key trends in the data analyst job market ‚Äî including the most in-demand skills and the highest-paying technologies. It uses SQL queries on a job postings dataset to extract insights that can help aspiring analysts and career switchers focus on the tools and skills that matter most.
You can check SQL queries here: [Project_sql folder](/Project_sql/)

# Tool I Usef 
- **SQL**: Used to write queries for extracting and analyzing job market data.  
- **PostgreSQL**: The database system where the data is stored and queried.  
- **Visual Studio Code**: My code editor for writing SQL scripts and managing the project files.  
- **Git**: Version control system to track changes and manage code history locally.  
- **GitHub**: Remote repository hosting service for collaboration and sharing the project online.

# The Analysis 
## üìà Analysis Overview

In this project, I analyzed job postings data specifically for Data Analyst roles to identify the most in-demand skills, the most paied salaries and the highest paying technologies. Using SQL queries on PostgreSQL, I extracted key insights on skill popularity, salary trends, and remote work opportunities. 

This analysis can help aspiring data analysts focus on the skills that are currently valued in the job market and make informed career decisions.
